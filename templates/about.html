        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with 
        Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his 
        long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the 
        king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering 
        that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the 
        Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew 
        that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed 
        that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn 
        Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered 
        thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave 
        on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their party.

            <h3>Thorin II Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince 
                Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. 
                Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely 
                Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. 
                While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. 
                This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of 
                Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven 
                armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the 
                fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch 
                found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," 
                which would remain with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen dwarves who set out 
                on Thorin Oakenshield's quest along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins to reclaim 
                the Lonely Mountain for the Dwarves.
                Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart 
                from Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" 
                characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's companions, who were 
                most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle 
                of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
                in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 
                joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain 
                wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
                would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his 
                brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company.
                He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled
                in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, 
                the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and 
                his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the 
                Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely 
                Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was
                noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin,
                was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. 
                Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.[1] After the battle, 
                he settled back into the Lonely Mountain.

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the 
                dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst 
                those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. 
                Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting 
                in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. 
                Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father
                of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but 
                Thráin was captured and lost.

                Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting 
                in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain 
                the Second and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

                Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years.

                Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the 
                other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of the Five Armies,
                and he survived it.

            <h3>Dori</h3>
            <p>
                Before The Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's home in the northern 
                Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori. In TA 2941, Dori and his two brothers
                became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling
                with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.
                Quest for Erebor Edit
                It fell to Dori to carry Bilbo Baggins in the tunnels of the Misty 
                Mountains during the escape from the Goblins, but Dori dropped Bilbo,
                and the other Dwarves and Gandalf blamed him for "losing their burglar." 
                Later, during their escape from the Wargs and Orcs, Dori helped Bilbo climb
                a tree to get away from the wargs. Bilbo shortly thereafter saved Dori by 
                grabbing his legs as they were rescued by the Great Eagles and taken to their
                eyrie in the Misty Mountains.

                Nori was the brother of Dori and Ori. Both Nori and Dori were capable flutists,
                and seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both these apparent brothers 
                also shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely 
                Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his
                two brothers.

                and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker.
                Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he

                Bombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned 
                are his brother Bofur and his cousin Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line 
                although he was descended from Dwarves of Moria. His birth year is also unknown, 
                however, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest to Erebor it is known that 
                the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the 13 "by some fifty years" and 
                that after Thorin had been captured, Balin was "the eldest left". Since Fíli was 
                born in TA 2859 and Balin was born in TA 2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 
                2763 and 2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the 
                quest to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue Mountains 
                with Thorin after the loss of Thráin II.

            <p>
                Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar
                (with the possible exception of Melian). He was a Maia of Manwë and Varda. 
                He also served under two other Valar, such as Irmo and Nienna. When the Valar 
                decided to send the order of the Istari (also known as Wizards) to Middle-earth, 
                to counsel and assist all those in Middle-earth who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron,
                Manwë and Varda decided to include Olórin among the five who were sent.
                At first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and too afraid
                of Sauron. Manwë understood, and told him that that was one main reason why he 
                should go, to overcome that fear. Thus, he insisted that Olórin should go as the
                third, but Varda convinced him not to include Olórin as the third, but as the second.
                Olórin agreed, and prepared for his departure from the Undying Lands with the
                other four wizards.
